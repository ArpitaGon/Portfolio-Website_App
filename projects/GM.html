        <h2>About: Rock,Paper,Scissors Game </h2> <br>
        <p>
            Online gaming is simply the playing of a video game over the internet, usually with friends. Online games can be played on any number of devices from dedicated video games consoles such as PlayStations, Xboxes, and Nintendo Switches, to PCs, laptops and mobile phones. <br> <br>

Online gaming provides many benefits. Unfortunately, it also comes with some risks. As well as developing gaming disorder, the ability to play and chat online with others around the world can leave children and young people open to scamming, grooming and online bullying. Loot boxes and skin betting have also received widespread attention for encouraging similar behaviour associated with gambling. <br> <br>

For these reasons, it is important that trusted adults educate themselves around what online gaming is and how they can ensure children and young people play safely. <br> <br>

The first video games were prototyped in the 1950s and 1960s, by the 1970s there was a whole industry created around video games. In fact, there were so many video games being produced that in 1983, the industry was in crisis because too many low-quality games were being made. <br> <br>

Video games are a form of media that is often associated with negative health consequences. However, when games are played in moderation and with mindfulness, they are a viable source of stress relief as well as a catalyst for mental health improvement and development of social skills. <br> <br>
