    <h2>About: Fashion Design Blog-Post</h2> <br> 
    <p>
        The emergence and extensive rise of digital technologies has widely enabled organisations and their consumers to interact and connect with one another through the internet platform. According to Deuze (2006, p. 68), utilisation of such has encouraged consumers to share their opinions, feelings and judgements of the products and services offered to their esteemed associations through the online platform with no much efforts. <br> <br>

        This has led to emergence of several online cultures as mediums for communication. In the use of online cultures, Yang (2003, p. 50) indicates that blogging is among the oldest and most traditional form, which started to emerge in the late twentieth century. Many authors have varied definitions of blogs due to its complexity. <br> <br>
        
        Technically, as Deuze (2006, p. 69) notes, blogs refer to websites that comprise of discrete entries, posts, or websites with contents written by a blogger. The contents are arranged in a reverse sequential order organised into categories. In the same way as noted, the advancement in technology has impelled a drastic shift in blog usage and concept development (Wright 2005, p. 7). <br> <br>
        
        In general, online culture can be categorised into several contents that include an individualâ€™s personal views and news, advertising, and customer services, internal information sharing, insight in professional issues, knowledge management application, and civil engagement function. <br> <br>
        
        As cited in Rocamoran (2011, p. 409), just like other blogging, fashion blogging has exponentially grown across the globe (Denegri-Knott and Molesworth 2013, p. 57). Moreover, numerous researches assert that the fashion industry has many well-known and famous bloggers as compared to other industries such as politics, food, tourism and travel industries. <br> <br>
        
        Fashion bloggers, as empirical research indicates, can influence the industry either directly or indirectly. Furthermore, as Kuhn (2007, p. 20) indicates, bloggers, apart from using their likes and dislikes to influence the way certain brands or products are presented, they can launch new trends in their respective industries and publicly discuss issues that companies are afraid to discuss in public.
