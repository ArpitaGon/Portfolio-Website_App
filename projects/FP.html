        <p>

Fruit is the sweet, fleshy, edible part of a plant. It generally contains seeds. Fruits are usually eaten raw, although some varieties can be cooked. They come in a wide variety of colours, shapes and flavours. <br> <br>
A fruit is the part of a flowering plant that contains the seeds.The skin of a fruit may be thin, tough, or hard. Its insides are often sweet and juicy. But some fruits, including nuts, are dry. Fruits develop from a plant's flowers. <br> <br>

Technically speaking, a fruit is a plant's developed ovary that comes from a flower and contains one or multiple seeds. The term vegetable is much broaderâ€”it refers to any part of a plant that's used for food, including the roots, tubers, stems, and leaves. <br> <br>

Simple fruits develop from a single carpel or fused carpels of a single ovary, while aggregate fruits develop from more than one carpel found on the same flower. Multiple fruits develop from a cluster of flowers, while accessory fruits do not develop from an ovary, but from other parts of a plant.
