        <h2>About: Welcome To Toronto</h2> <br>
        <p>
            Toronto is Canada's largest city and a world leader in business, finance, technology, entertainment and culture. Its large population of immigrants from all over the globe has also made Toronto one of the most multicultural cities in the world. <br> <br>
            <b>Diversity Our Strength</b> <br>
            This is where the motto “Diversity Our Strength” came from. The Beaver: The beaver, a symbol of industry, has appeared on the coat of arms of the City of Toronto since 1834. <br> <br>
            Nicknames for Toronto are nothing new : T-dot, T.O. the 6ix, Hogtown to name a few : but a new poll shows that most of us still refuse to use any moniker for our city. <br> <br>

The city's bustling economy, vibrant culture, and diverse population make all the difference in making the city attractive to newcomers. <br> <br>
The city functions on a worldwide scale; it is an international powerhouse for commerce and finance, most recently tech, it is often regarded as one of the most multicultural and friendliest cities in the world, and there must be a reason why 2.8 million people have chosen to call Toronto home.
