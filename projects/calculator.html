A calculator is a machine which allows people to do math operations more easily. For example, most calculators will add, subtract, multiply, and divide. Some also do square roots, and more complex calculators can help with calculus and draw function graphs. <br> <br>

The purpose of a calculator is to do correct calculations, and to do so efficiently. It is clear that a calculator should relieve the user of the need to do mental operations and of the need to rely on paper, so far as possible. <br> <br>

a small electronic or mechanical device that performs calculations, requiring manual action for each individual operation. <br> <br>

A four-function calculator should contain only basic functions including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
