        <h2>About: Art Gallery</h2> <br>
        <p>

Art is a creative activity and technical skill. It produces a product, an object. Art is a diverse range of human activities in creating visual, performing subjects, and expressing the author's thoughts. The product of art is called a work of art, for others to experience. <br> <br>

An art gallery is an exhibition space to display and sell artworks. As a result, the art gallery is a commercial enterprise working with a portfolio of artists. The gallery acts as the dealer representing, supporting, and distributing the artworks by the artists in question. <br> <br>

Your mind and creativity get stimulated, and you can learn about your culture, history, and the world. Visiting art galleries is also an excellent way to reduce stress. This is because seeing art allows you to take a break from your busy day and will enable you to be in just the moment. <br> <br>

The purpose of art gallery is to collect and preserve the results of human achievement and evidence of the natural world and to use these collections to enhance human knowledge and understanding. <br> <br>

The broad mission of museums and art galleries is to collect, conserve, study and display items of artistic, historical, scientific or cultural importance.
